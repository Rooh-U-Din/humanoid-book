# Specification Quality Checklist: Reusable Intelligence with Subagents

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- All 6 user stories have independent test criteria
- 22 functional requirements defined covering architecture, skills, auth, logging, and extensibility
- 9 measurable success criteria established
- Dependencies on feature 001-betterauth-access-control clearly documented
- Out of scope items explicitly listed to prevent scope creep

## Validation Summary

| Category | Items | Passed | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 8 | PASS |
| Feature Readiness | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **PASS** |

**Result**: Specification passes all quality checks. Ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
